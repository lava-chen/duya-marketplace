description: "Use this skill any time a spreadsheet file is the primary input or output. This means any task where the user wants to: open, read, edit, or fix an existing .xlsx, .xlsm, .csv, or .tsv file (e.g., adding columns, computing formulas, formatting, charting, cleaning messy data); create a new spreadsheet from scratch or from other data sources; or convert between tabular file formats. Trigger especially when the user references a spreadsheet file by name or path — even casually (like \"the xlsx in my downloads\") — and wants something done to it or produced from it. Also trigger for cleaning or restructuring messy tabular data files (malformed rows, misplaced headers, junk data) into proper spreadsheets. The deliverable must be a spreadsheet file. Do NOT trigger when the primary deliverable is a Word document, HTML report, standalone Python script, database pipeline, or Google Sheets API integration, even if tabular data is involved."

# Requirements for Outputs

## All Excel files

### Professional Font
- Use a consistent, professional font (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman) for all deliverables unless otherwise instructed by the user

### Zero Formula Errors
- Every Excel model MUST be delivered with ZERO formula errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, #N/A, #NAME?)

### Preserve Existing Templates (when updating templates)
- Study and EXACTLY match existing format, style, and conventions when modifying files
- Never impose standardized formatting on files with established patterns
- Existing template conventions ALWAYS override these guidelines

## Financial models

### Color Coding Standards
Unless otherwise stated by the user or existing template

#### Industry-Standard Color Conventions
- **Blue text (RGB: 0,0,255)**: Hardcoded inputs, and numbers users will change for scenarios
- **Black text (RGB: 0,0,0)**: ALL formulas and calculations
- **Green text (RGB: 0,128,0)**: Links pulling from other worksheets within same workbook
- **Red text (RGB: 255,0,0)**: External links to other files
- **Yellow background (RGB: 255,255,0)**: Key assumptions needing attention or cells that need to be updated

### Number Formatting Standards

#### Required Format Rules
- **Years**: Format as text strings (e.g., "2024" not "2,024")
- **Currency**: Use $#,##0 format; ALWAYS specify units in headers ("Revenue ($mm)")
- **Zeros**: Use number formatting to make all zeros "-", including percentages (e.g., "$#,##0;($#,##0);-")
- **Percentages**: Default to 0.0% format (one decimal)
- **Multiples**: Format as 0.0x for valuation multiples (EV/EBITDA, P/E)
- **Negative numbers**: Use parentheses (123) not minus -123

### Formula Construction Rules

#### Assumptions Placement
- Place ALL assumptions (growth rates, margins, multiples, etc.) in separate assumption cells
- Use cell references instead of hardcoded values in formulas
- Example: Use =B5*(1+$B$6) instead of =B5*1.05

#### Formula Error Prevention
- Verify all cell references are correct
- Check for off-by-one errors in ranges
- Ensure consistent formulas across all projection periods
- Test with edge cases (zero values, negative numbers)
- Verify no unintended circular references

#### Documentation Requirements for Hardcodes
- Comment or in cells beside (if end of table). Format: "Source: [System/Document], [Date], [Specific Reference], [URL if applicable]"
- Examples:
  - "Source: Company 10-K, FY2024, Page 45, Revenue Note, [SEC EDGAR URL]"
  - "Source: Company 10-Q, Q2 2025, Exhibit 99.1, [SEC EDGAR URL]"
  - "Source: Bloomberg Terminal, 8/15/2025, AAPL US Equity"
  - "Source: FactSet, 8/20/2025, Consensus Estimates Screen"

# XLSX creation, editing, and analysis

## Overview

A user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of an .xlsx file. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.

## Important Instructions

- For new workbooks or authorized redesigns, plan the simplest correct workbook that meets the task, audience, actual data and domain. If formulas become hard to read, first reconsider whether the workbook's structure, layout, or logic is overcomplicated before simplifying individual formulas. Remove unnecessary or duplicated logic while preserving calculation correctness, required business relationships, and financial reconciliation.
- Instruction precedence for workbook content, layout, and formatting is: user request > reference/template > domain defaults/conventions > general defaults.

Identify the user's task/function, role, audience and industry separately, then
read the relevant domain guide. Financial forecasts, budgets, cash models and
valuations use the Finance guidance in any industry; a healthcare company's
financial forecast still uses Finance guidance, while an appointment tracker
does not inherit financial-model structure or colors.

## Important Requirements

**LibreOffice Required for Formula Recalculation**: You can assume LibreOffice is installed for recalculating formula values using the `scripts/recalc.py` script. The script automatically configures LibreOffice on first run, including in sandboxed environments where Unix sockets are restricted (handled by `scripts/office/soffice.py`)

## Reading and analyzing data

### Data analysis with pandas
For data analysis, visualization, and basic operations, use **pandas** which provides powerful data manipulation capabilities:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read Excel
df = pd.read_excel('file.xlsx')  # Default: first sheet
all_sheets = pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', sheet_name=None)  # All sheets as dict

# Analyze
df.head()      # Preview data
df.info()      # Column info
df.describe()  # Statistics

# Write Excel
df.to_excel('output.xlsx', index=False)
```

## Excel File Workflows

## CRITICAL: Use Formulas, Not Hardcoded Values

**Always use Excel formulas instead of calculating values in Python and hardcoding them.** This ensures the spreadsheet remains dynamic and updateable.

### ❌ WRONG - Hardcoding Calculated Values
```python
# Bad: Calculating in Python and hardcoding result
total = df['Sales'].sum()
sheet['B10'] = total  # Hardcodes 5000

# Bad: Computing growth rate in Python
growth = (df.iloc[-1]['Revenue'] - df.iloc[0]['Revenue']) / df.iloc[0]['Revenue']
sheet['C5'] = growth  # Hardcodes 0.15

# Bad: Python calculation for average
avg = sum(values) / len(values)
sheet['D20'] = avg  # Hardcodes 42.5
```

### ✅ CORRECT - Using Excel Formulas
```python
# Good: Let Excel calculate the sum
sheet['B10'] = '=SUM(B2:B9)'

# Good: Growth rate as Excel formula
sheet['C5'] = '=(C4-C2)/C2'

# Good: Average using Excel function
sheet['D20'] = '=AVERAGE(D2:D19)'
```

This applies to ALL calculations - totals, percentages, ratios, differences, etc. The spreadsheet should be able to recalculate when source data changes.

## Common Workflow
1. **Choose tool**: pandas for data, openpyxl for formulas/formatting
2. **Create/Load**: Create new workbook or load existing file
3. **Modify**: Add/edit data, formulas, and formatting
4. **Save**: Write to file
5. **Recalculate formulas (MANDATORY IF USING FORMULAS)**: Use the scripts/recalc.py script
   ```bash
   python scripts/recalc.py output.xlsx
   ```
6. **Verify and fix any errors**: 
   - The script returns JSON with error details
   - If `status` is `errors_found`, check `error_summary` for specific error types and locations
   - Fix the identified errors and recalculate again
   - Common errors to fix:
     - `#REF!`: Invalid cell references
     - `#DIV/0!`: Division by zero
     - `#VALUE!`: Wrong data type in formula
     - `#NAME?`: Unrecognized formula name

### Creating new Excel files

```python
# Using openpyxl for formulas and formatting
from openpyxl import Workbook
from openpyxl.styles import Font, PatternFill, Alignment

wb = Workbook()
sheet = wb.active

# Add data
sheet['A1'] = 'Hello'
sheet['B1'] = 'World'
sheet.append(['Row', 'of', 'data'])

# Add formula
sheet['B2'] = '=SUM(A1:A10)'

# Formatting
sheet['A1'].font = Font(bold=True, color='FF0000')
sheet['A1'].fill = PatternFill('solid', start_color='FFFF00')
sheet['A1'].alignment = Alignment(horizontal='center')

# Column width
sheet.column_dimensions['A'].width = 20

wb.save('output.xlsx')
```

### Editing existing Excel files

```python
# Using openpyxl to preserve formulas and formatting
from openpyxl import load_workbook

# Load existing file
wb = load_workbook('existing.xlsx')
sheet = wb.active  # or wb['SheetName'] for specific sheet

# Working with multiple sheets
for sheet_name in wb.sheetnames:
    sheet = wb[sheet_name]
    print(f"Sheet: {sheet_name}")

# Modify cells
sheet['A1'] = 'New Value'
sheet.insert_rows(2)  # Insert row at position 2
sheet.delete_cols(3)  # Delete column 3

# Add new sheet
new_sheet = wb.create_sheet('NewSheet')
new_sheet['A1'] = 'Data'

wb.save('modified.xlsx')
```

## Recalculating formulas

Excel files created or modified by openpyxl contain formulas as strings but not calculated values. Use the provided `scripts/recalc.py` script to recalculate formulas:

```bash
python scripts/recalc.py <excel_file> [timeout_seconds]
```

Example:
```bash
python scripts/recalc.py output.xlsx 30
```

The script:
- Automatically sets up LibreOffice macro on first run
- Recalculates all formulas in all sheets
- Scans ALL cells for Excel errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, etc.)
- Returns JSON with detailed error locations and counts
- Works on both Linux and macOS

## Formula Verification Checklist

Quick checks to ensure formulas work correctly:

### Essential Verification
- [ ] **Test 2-3 sample references**: Verify they pull correct values before building full model
- [ ] **Column mapping**: Confirm Excel columns match (e.g., column 64 = BL, not BK)
- [ ] **Row offset**: Remember Excel rows are 1-indexed (DataFrame row 5 = Excel row 6)

### Common Pitfalls
- [ ] **NaN handling**: Check for null values with `pd.notna()`
- [ ] **Far-right columns**: FY data often in columns 50+ 
- [ ] **Multiple matches**: Search all occurrences, not just first
- [ ] **Division by zero**: Check denominators before using `/` in formulas (#DIV/0!)
- [ ] **Wrong references**: Verify all cell references point to intended cells (#REF!)
- [ ] **Cross-sheet references**: Use correct format (Sheet1!A1) for linking sheets

### Formula Testing Strategy
- [ ] **Start small**: Test formulas on 2-3 cells before applying broadly
- [ ] **Verify dependencies**: Check all cells referenced in formulas exist
- [ ] **Test edge cases**: Include zero, negative, and very large values

### Interpreting scripts/recalc.py Output
The script returns JSON with error details:
```json
{
  "status": "success",           // or "errors_found"
  "total_errors": 0,              // Total error count
  "total_formulas": 42,           // Number of formulas in file
  "error_summary": {              // Only present if errors found
    "#REF!": {
      "count": 2,
      "locations": ["Sheet1!B5", "Sheet1!C10"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Data Formatting Rules

- Store numbers, percentages, currency, and dates as typed spreadsheet values, not preformatted strings. Use text only for true identifiers such as ZIP codes, account IDs, SKUs, or labels.
- Use Excel-invariant number/date format codes, not locale-specific display strings. Generic numeric examples include `#,##0`, `#,##0.0`, `0.0%`, `0.00%`, `"$"#,##0`, `"$"#,##0.00`. Preserve source dates and unrelated existing formats.
- Percentages: Follow the domain or reference's precision. Otherwise, use 1 decimal for most analytical cells, 0 decimals for dashboard outputs, and 2 decimals where small rate differences matter.
- Do not swap `.` and `,` in format codes to mimic locale separators; separators are controlled by spreadsheet/render locale. Use `0.0%`, not `0,0%`, and `#,##0`, not `#.##0`.
- Choose the appropriate format for readability. Match precision to meaning: counts use `#,##0`; rates usually use `0.0%` or `0.00%`; currency uses whole units unless cents matter.
- For dates in data columns, default to a short date format appropriate to the workbook's language/location, such as `mm/dd/yy` for the US. Follow explicit user preferences and reference/template or domain conventions.
- Keep underlying dates numeric and sortable. A display format does not change the period represented or authorize aggregation. Fit the final display so dates do not truncate or show `####`.

## Citation Requirements

These are defaults for new workbooks: user instructions, reference/template conventions and domain guidance take precedence. For edits, follow the workbook's existing citation practices.

- Cite real sources when they exist.
- Keep citations and sources in one place: an existing input tab (sources or data tab) or in the correct input section in a tab, alongside the input data.
- Two ways to cite a source:
  1. (Preferred) Inline in the input tab when the tab exists.
     - If there are multiple unique sources (different pages/lines don't count), inline them in an adjacent cell at the table's end, with one column as a buffer, when a table exists.
     - If there is a single source, just have a single cell above the data, left aligned.
  2. (Fallback) Cell note, not a comment/thread, with the citation. Only do this for hardcoded inputs not on a separate input tab, such as an input area on a build sheet. For adjacent cells in the same row or column that come from the same source, do not add duplicate cell notes. Never add citation notes to titles or headers.
- If there is no clear place for sources, return sources in chat. Do not add a tab just for citations.
- Citation format should follow best practice for domain, default to `(Source: Company 10-K, FY2026, Page 20, Revenue Note, [URL LINK])`.
- Do not add citations, comments or notes to cover/presentation tabs or output regions unless requested. On a mixed-use sheet, citations may sit beside the input data, outside the output region.
- When comments are requested, keep them succinct, minimal and easy to read.
- Do not add a different annotation type to a cell that already has one. Update an existing note/comment/thread rather than layering another system over it.
- Do not add cell comments unless the user requests them. Preserve existing annotations.

## Best Practices

### Library Selection
- **pandas**: Best for data analysis, bulk operations, and simple data export
- **openpyxl**: Best for complex formatting, formulas, and Excel-specific features

### Working with openpyxl
- Cell indices are 1-based (row=1, column=1 refers to cell A1)
- Use `data_only=True` to read calculated values: `load_workbook('file.xlsx', data_only=True)`
- **Warning**: If opened with `data_only=True` and saved, formulas are replaced with values and permanently lost
- For large files: Use `read_only=True` for reading or `write_only=True` for writing
- Formulas are preserved but not evaluated - use scripts/recalc.py to update values

### Working with pandas
- Specify data types to avoid inference issues: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', dtype={'id': str})`
- For large files, read specific columns: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', usecols=['A', 'C', 'E'])`
- Handle dates properly: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', parse_dates=['date_column'])`

## Code Style Guidelines
**IMPORTANT**: When generating Python code for Excel operations:
- Write minimal, concise Python code without unnecessary comments
- Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations
- Avoid unnecessary print statements

**For Excel files themselves**:
- Add comments to cells with complex formulas or important assumptions
- Document data sources for hardcoded values
- Include notes for key calculations and model sections
